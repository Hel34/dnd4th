guns use the mechanics of spells, with a few differences:
-if a gun is the ONLY spell in use of a player,
it has no attunement cost.
-Guns have an extra property: reach, which consists of 4 distances:
    -The first number is the distance in which a hit is guaranteed.
    -The second is the range in which a dexterity throw of DC10 is needed.
    -The 3rd is the range in which a dexterity throw of DC15 is needed.
    -the 4th is the maximum range, beyond this no hit is possible
Otherwise (unless the rules of the gun contradicts them)
the same rules as for spells apply.
